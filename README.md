# The Beginning

Everything started with my favorite series, [Gravity Falls](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls). Well, I know… it doesn’t make sense, but let me continue. I was very young and the first time I heard the word AWESOME was in a [Bill Cipher video parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iErPRULgIpg). At that time, my English skills were probably at level A1 or A2. So, not very impressive. Maybe it is because of our history and school system. In my opinion, my younger sister will be much better at English language than me. Nowadays, we live in a globalized world, and the exposure is greater than when I was younger. That’s awesome, right? For me? Definitely not. But for my sister? Absolutely, yes!
