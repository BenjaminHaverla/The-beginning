# The Beginning

Everything started with my favorite series, [Gravity Falls](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls). Well, I know… it doesn’t make sense, but let me continue. I was very young and the first time I heard the word AWESOME was in a [Bill Cipher video parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iErPRULgIpg). At that time, my English skills were probably at level A1 or A2. So, not very impressive. Maybe it is because of our history and school system. In my opinion, my younger sister will be much better at English language than me. Nowadays, we live in a globalized world, and the exposure is greater than when I was younger. That’s awesome, right? For me? Definitely not. But for my sister? Absolutely, yes! 

### [So how could I improve my skills?]()

The only option for me was to study hard with the English language and work on myself. Maybe that’s the reason why teachers had a strong influence on me. "Awesome…" Yes, I said it loudly in front of my English teacher from primary school. Believe me or not, it wasn’t that awesome. When she heard that word, her voice grew louder: "Never say it again! Not in front of me!" That was the point when my existential questioning began. Why did she say that? Is it wrong? Did I use bad grammar? If it’s wrong, then why was it used in a video parody? Because she was strict, I wasn’t brave enough to ask her why.
